        <p>This is an
        NSF/<a href="http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/K040138/1">EPSRC</a>
        funded collaboration that will develop and deploy robust and
        sustainable software for advanced potential energy
        surfaces. The greater accuracy introduced by improvements in
        the new generation of potential energy surfaces opens up
        several challenges in their implementation as algorithms and
        software on current and emergent hardware platforms. This in
        turn limits their wide adoption by the computational chemistry
        community. The research team is overcoming these obstacles via
        multiple but integrated directions: </p>

<ol>
<li>to optimally implement advanced potential energy surfaces across multi-core and GPU enabled systems,</li>
<li>to develop a hierarchy of advanced polarizable models that alter the trade-off between accuracy and computational speed,</li>
<li>to create new multiple time stepping methods;</li>
<li>to write a Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM ) application programming interface (API) that fully supports mutual polarization,</li>
<li>to adopt software best practices to ensure growth of a self-sustaining community and </li>
<li>to provide exemplar calculations with the new software in several emerging application areas.</li>
